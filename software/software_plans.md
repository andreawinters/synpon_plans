# SynPon software ideas

- Develop a space based shooter or strategy game that uses OSVR and CryEngine and make it available on the Steam marketplace.
- ~~Develop a Reinforcement Learning Library of Algorithms that work with ROS/Gazebo, and Gym environments.~~
- Write my own algorithm in `rllab`, then add it to `gps`.
- Write up an industrial robot ROS package for the Moveo with compliant hand after building it.
- Re-write `gps_agent_pkg` to control the Moveo with compliant hand. Going to have to build a lot of ROS packages for an industrial robot interface to the arm and hand.

- Use force feedback from the joints to make the arm compliant so it will be a cobot.

- Buy an OpenVR or HTC Vive headset once they start to support Linux and write up a GUI that uses VR to interface with the operating system. Look into generative ML to create artificial environments and analogies in the environment so the commands can be customized to be weird, cool stuff in VR.
