# Open Source Manipulator

I am going to buy a 3D printer kit for less than $700 from [BCN3DTechnologies](BCN3DTechnologies.com).

I need a large 3D printer so I can print the parts for the [Moveo](https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo), seen below.

It might only use stepper motors at the present, but I'm sure that I would be better equipped to build a more serious robot arm for use in precision industrial manufacturing where such high repeatability is needed after having built this arm that if it were my first attempt at building an arm from scratch. I can upgrade the design with better servos after I build my first attempt.
